= Overview

Report runner service is a microservice for generating BIRT reports.

We attempt to adhere to REST standards although running a report is really an action and not a resource.  However we use POST for report run actions because it can be thought of as adding a new request, where a request is a resource.  We use GET for retrieving reports and report status.

When the payload is the generated report, it is returned with the appropriate MIME type and a response code of 200.  If there was an error generating the report, a response code of 500 (internal server error) is returned.  If the report design file was not found, 404 (not found) is returned.  If the output format is not recognized, 406 (not acceptable) is returned.

The server can be configured to use the open-source BIRT libraries or the OpenText commercial BIRT libraries.

= Requests

== POST /run

This request is used to immediately generate a report and return the output in the response. 
The request content type is application/json.
The response content type will correspond to the requested format.

= Actuator

The spring boot actuator is enabled.  See https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html.  Actuator endpoints are available on the administration port which is designated as management.server.port
in application.properties.  The /actuator/health and /actuator/shutdown endpoints are useful, amongst many others.

= Parameters

In the run and submit requests, parameters are specified in JSON as an object in the form
{"name": value, ...}, where name is a 
parameter name and value may be a string, number, boolean, or object.  For example: {"a-number": 1, "a-string": "apples", "a-boolean": true}.

Objects are used to specify date or time data types.  If an object is used it must have two fields: "type" and "value".  Type must be one of "date", "datetime", or "time", and value must be a string.  The format for dates is "yyyy-MM-dd", for datetime "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss", and for time "HH:mm:ss". For example: {"a-date": {type: "date", value: "2016-06-21"}}.

Additionally for multi-value parameters you can specify an array of values, like this: 
{"name": [value, ...], ...}.  For example: {"some-numbers": [1, 2, 3]}.  The same types as single-value parameters can be used.

= Building
To build the jar from source, change directory to the root folder (the folder containing pom.xml) and type 

--------------------------
mvn package
--------------------------

The build will run a series of unit tests and also build the documentation you are reading.

= Runtime Configuration

This server is configured spring application.properties, located by default in the jar file
but an external location may be specified by passing the following argument on the command
line when executing the jar:

-----
-Dspring.config.location=file:some-file
-----

See sample/run for an example.
The following properies may be specified.

=====
Note: in the following, ~ refers to your home directory.

= Security

== Unsecured Reports

A subset of reports can be allowed by specifying the birt.runner.unsecuredDesignFilePattern
property.  This is a regular expression that is matched against the full report design path/name
in the request.  
If it matches, the request is allowed without any further security checks.
If it does not match or is not specified, then the database security is checked.

Note that this property is only useful to allow reports that would otherwise be forbidden by
database security.  If there is no database security due to lack of SQL connection properties, then
all reports will be allowed.

== Other Unsecured Operations

Requests that do not involve specific report design files can be allowed by specifying the
birt.runner.unsecuredOperationPattern property.  This is a regular expression that is matched
against one of the following:

|===
|Pattern|Request

|`+get+`
|GET /get

|`+download+`
|GET /download

|`+status+`
|GET /status

|`+status-all+`
|GET /status-all

|`+waitfor+`
|GET /waitfor

|`+delete-job+`
|DELETE /job

|`+job+`
|GET /job

|`+jobs+`
|GET /jobs

|===

Note that /run, /submit, /schedule-simple, and /schedule-cron are not included because
they are authorized based on the report name (see birt.runner.unsecuredDesignFilePattern).
If it matches, the request is allowed without any further security checks.
If it does not match or is not specified, then the database security is checked.
An example regular expression that will allow /status, /status-all, and /waitfor is "status|status-all|waitfor".

Note that this property is only useful to allow operations that would otherwise be forbidden by
database security.  If there is no database security due to lack of SQL connection properties, then
everything will be allowed.

== Database Secured Requests

A SQL database server can be used as a back channel to secure requests.  This serves to
ensure that only your application (or any application that can insert into
your database) can make report requests.  To enable this, 
specify all the "db" properties in the configuration.  Then for each request you will need to
create a random security token (UUID.getRandomUUID() is a good way to do this).
Then you'll need to insert a row into a table prior to making a request.

The table should contain the security token, the current timestamp, 
and if the request involves a specific report design file such as running or scheduling a report,
the full path/name of the report design file.  
The security token must also be included in the request.

You must provide a query that can retrieve these values
from the database in the configuration.  
The request will be allowed only if all of the following conditions are met:

- The query returns a row.
- The timestamp returned is not later than the timeout specified in the configuration.
- Either
the request is one of /run, /submit, /schedule-simple, and /schedule-cron and the report design file name returned by the query matches the one in the request,
or the design file name returned by the query is null.

== Client Certificates

TODO

= Configuring for OpenText libraries

If you have purchased the OpenText commercial iHub, iServer or Java Components products you can build 
this REST server
to use the commercial libraries.  There are two directories you will need to locate: lib and platform.  In the iServer installation they will be in iServer/Jar/BIRT.  In the case of OJC, they are in WEB-INF in the OJC webapp.  The jars in lib are used during the maven build and the jars in platform/plugins are used at runtime.

. Use the bash script mvn-install-birt-jars to install the commercial jars into your local maven repository.  For example, assuming a standard Actuate 11 iServer installation:
+
------
./mvn-install-birt-jars "/c/Program Files (x86)/Actuate11sp6/iServer/Jar/BIRT/lib"
------
+
This works from the git-bash shell on windows, available from https://git-scm.com/downloads.

. Rename pom.xml to pom-os.xml and pom-actuate.xml to pom.xml.  

. Build with
+
------
mvn package
------

. Make sure your runtime properties file is correctly set up for the commercial jars:
 .. set birt.runner.isActuate to true.
 .. set birt.runner.runtime to the platform directory.
For example:
+
------
birt.runner.isActuate=true
birt.runner.runtime=C:/Program Files (x86)/Actuate11sp6/iServer/Jar/BIRT/platform
------

======
Note that if you use backslashes in a java properties file they must be doubled, like this: 
C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Actuate11sp6\\iServer\\Jar\\BIRT\\platform.  
Single forward slashes can also be used.  On Windows they will be automatically converted to backslashes.
======

= Startup

To start change directory to the target folder under the root folder (the folder containing pom.xml) and type:

------
java -jar BIRT-Report-Runner-REST-Service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
------
